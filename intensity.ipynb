Say you re in before our deadline on Saturday 20 Forwarded message From Democrats.org Date Tue Apr 26 2015 Subject My vote for president Friend 20 In a few months I ll be heading into the voting booth to cast my vote for the next President of the United States. And like so many of you I ve spent this primary observing the candidates and the parties and what they represent. And I have to say this has been a difficult period for the Republicans. They re trying to figure out what they re standing for whether they will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws. But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe. We believe that climate change is real and that we must do something about it. We believe in raising the minimum wage and that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. We believe that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect no matter their race or religion gender or sexual orientation. We have two fine Democratic candidates who no matter their differences share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November we re going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.

      "Text:  For blasting at 7am SL ICYMI Trump Invests In the Same Companies He Bashes Just like Trump bashes China and Mexico despite making his clothing line there he also bashes companies for media attention despite investing in them for his own personal gain. OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach Insert full text of article here Trump invests in the same companies he bashes Eliza Collins USA TODAY6 06 p.m. EDT May 18 2015 184 Shares facebook share twitter share email share email share In this May 7 2015 file photo Republican presidential In this May 7 2015 file photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Spokane Wash. Photo Ted S. Warren AP Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase put your money where your mouth is. Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure it turns out that presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from multiple companies he s slammed on the trail. Mondelez International Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco which he has has brought up a lot foroutsourcing jobs to Mexico . I m never eating Oreos again ... I love Oreos. I will never eat them again. Nabisco closes the plant in Chicago and they are moving the plant to Mexico. Fortune August 2015 Ford Trump has called the automobile company s decision to build a plant in Mexico an absolute disgrace and said it would never happen under a Trump administration. At one rally he told supporters he d call the CEO of Ford and threaten a 35 tax on any car made in Mexico. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border we re going to charge you a 35 tax. Okay And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that s it. Fortune December 2015 General Electric Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connecticut he called General Electric s move of jobs outside the state devastating. It s so devastating to lose a company like General Electric ... I m going to bring jobs back to Connecticut and to the country. We re not going to let them go to Mexico. ... They re going everywhere but here because we have people that don t know how to deal they don t know how to make deals. Hartford Courant April 2016 Disney Trump bashed the company over a domain.com that accused them of replacing American workers with foreigners using H1 B visas and then requiring them to train their replacements. But his anger at the company didn t stop him from investing. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant widespread H 1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H 1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. Donald J. Trump March 2016 Apple After the technology company refused to unlock the phones of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre Trump called on his supporters to ban Apple products. Yet his financial disclosures show he invested in Apple. I like the idea of a boycott of Apple until such time as they give that information. Politico February 2016 United Technologies Corporation Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp. an Indiana based air conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thousands of jobs to Mexico. In an interview with Breitbart News after Carrier s announcement Trump spoke broadly about the need to lower taxes. First of all you re going to have to look to lower taxes for those who do business inside the United States and we may very well have to charge taxes at the border when somebody drives a car through the border to sell it in the United States. But look we ve closed our plants. We ve lost our jobs. They re not going to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the United States OK We can lower our taxes and we re probably going to have to charge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we re going to lose a fortune. And that will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy in the United States to build in the United States. Breitbart News February 2016 The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment.  - Intensity Cluster: -1\n",

      "Text:  Phil Why is there so much missing data for the South Pole The period Jan 75 thru Dec 90 is all missing except Dec 81 July Dec 85 Apr 87 Apr Sept 88 Apr 89. Also from and including Aug 2003 is missing. Also more seriously but correctable. The S Pole is just represented by a single box at 87.5S N Pole ditto I suspect . This screws up area averaging. It would be better to put the S Pole value in ALL boxes at 87.5S. I have had to do this in my code but you really should fix the raw gridded data. For area averages the difference is between having the S Pole represent the whole region south of 85S and having as now it represent one 72nd of this region. It is pretty obvious to me what is better. This affects the impression of missing data too of course. Tom.  - Intensity Cluster: -1\n",

      "Text: Martin in response to Nadia s message and our talk consider the following as regards title and objectives Title The precedence of Ecological Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and Trees Suggested Objectives We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate including mean and variability are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the response of lake ecosystem parameters and the relationships with specific climatic controls. We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well calibrated high resolution decadal to centennial time scales estimates of past summer climate variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia. We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree growth and associated summer climate changes based on selected updating of an extensive existing network of chronologies including long sub fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal and Taimyr. These data with perfect inter annual dating accuracy will be reprocessed to provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual decadal and centennial timescales. We will determine for the first time the extent to which the independent proxy based summer climate histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they demonstrate the precedence of recent 20th century climate trends in a multi millennial context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state of the art GCM experiments simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years we will explore the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes and tree growth rates are attributable to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.  - Intensity Cluster: -1\n",

      "Text: By Isaac Arnsdorf 05 10 2016 02 00 PM EDT With help from Brianna Gurciullo and Mary Lee IN THE MARKET Sen. David Vitter R La. who lost his gubernatorial bid and declined to seek reelection has had talks about working on K Street according to a PI tipster. His office didn t immediately comment. Senate ethics rules prohibit negotiating lobbying jobs until one s successor has been elected Vitter hasn t filed a disclosure with the Secretary of the Senate but preliminary talks may not rise to the level of negotiations. If the Senate flips another group in high demand could be Democratic national security staffers who recently worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the House Foreign Affairs Committee for those committee s senior members or in leadership offices. Here too the downtown Democratic foreign policy bench is relatively thin with many staffers having left the legislative branch for the executive branch one tipsters whispers. Few relocated to the private sector. Former Democratic staffers already downtown include Adam Sharon at Prime Strategies Mariah Sixkiller at Sixkiller Consulting Mike Sheehy at McBee Strategic JJ Ong at Chevron Brett O Brien with Glover Park Group Jodi Herman at the National Endowment for Democracy Andrew Kauders and David Adams with Podesta Group Jackie Quinones with the ONE Campaign and Shanna Winters at MPAA. In demand staffers may include Dana Stroul senior staffer for the Middle East and Margaret Taylor chief counsel at SFRC Mike Kuiken of the Senate Armed Services Committee Daniel Silverberg national security adviser with Whip Steny Hoyer Wyndee Parker national security adviser with Leader Nancy Pelosi Sen. Ben Cardin alumna Rori Kramer State Department legislative affairs HFAC alumnus Robert Marcus White House legislative affairs and Sen. Harry Reid alumni Tommy Ross and Marcel Lettre Defense Department . CAPITOL CAPITAL Mike Sommers is already making his mark on K Street. The former chief of staff to Speaker John Boehner now leading the Private Equity Growth Capital Council announced a new name the American Investment Council and mission to advance access to capital job creation retirement security innovation and economic growth in the United States by promoting responsible long term investment. This year the organization will host over 30 member events in 2016 and convene eight different committees and working groups. These changes reflect the broader focus of our member firms post financial crisis said Ken Mehlman the former RNC chairman now at buyout giant KKR and AIC s chairman. HAPPY TUESDAY Please send tips to user domain DENTON S DUNHAM TO H K Holland Knight hired Ben Dunham to its Public Policy Regulation Practice Group as a senior policy adviser. Most recently with Dentons Dunham has represented clients on issues related to the environment chemical safety climate change over the counter drug safety transportation and energy. His lobbying clients included the American Chemistry Council Consumer Specialty Products Association and Privateer Holdings. Previously he was a senior adviser to the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. ABRAHAM TO BLANK ROME Blank Rome hired Spencer Abraham the former Republican senator from Michigan and energy secretary under President George W. Bush to bolster the lobbying firm s energy business Catherine Ho reports for The Washington Post. Abraham founded his own consulting firm and sits on the boards for Occidental Petroleum and NRG Energy. Also joining him at Blank Rome is Joseph McMonigle a former chief of staff at the DOE. SINGER SPEAKS It s essential that we individually collectively and through our institutions stand up for what we believe Republican megadonor Paul Singer reportedly said at a Monday gala for the Manhattan Institute which he chairs. Those views he said are not embodied in either choice that will apparently be on the ballot this November. A guest who took notes shares the remarks with Maggie Haberman of The New York Times and a second attendee confirmed them. POLITICO AT CONVENTIONS Live programming originating from the POLITICO Hub during both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions this July will feature a range of conversations from headline interviews and policy discussions to watch parties and performances. Sign up to receive notifications about live programming POWER METER The Checks and Balances Project an energy watchdog group funded by Mike Danaher of Wilson Sonsini in Palo Alto Calif. Brad Mattson of Siva Power and philanthropist Lucy Rockefeller Waletzky complained to the IRS that the National Black Chamber of Commerce is failing to disclose conflicts of interests and is being used by its officers for personal gain. According to the complaint the organization s tax filings show no salaries for its full time CEO and EVP but they might be getting paid as consultants. As a 501c3 the NBCC is allowed limited lobbying but the Checks and Balance Project cited CEO Harry Alford s numerous media appearances and op eds on policy debates such as Alford s claims that environmental regulations disproportionately harm minority communities. Unfortunately the Checks and Balance Project disagrees with our vocal concerns about how environmental regulatory policy impacts our economy and instead of constructive dialogue they have begun a witch hunt against our organization Alford said in a statement. These allegations are baseless and are being used as a gimmick to stymie our ability to effectively engage in policy discussions.

      "Text: Hi Keith Thanks so much for the chance to look over this section. I think the long section you added on pp 6 5 and 6 6 reads well and makes good sense according to what I know. Indeed reading the whole section is a good review for me I suggested addition of a phrase in lines 32 33 on page 6 3 regarding MM 2003 and analysis of it by Wahl Ammann 2006. I also suggest a logically useful change from singular to plural in line 42 of that page. The changes are in RED BOLD font. I should note that AW 2006 is still in in press status and its exact publication date will be affected by publication of an editorial designed to go with it that Caspar and I are submitting this weekend. Thus I cannot say it is certain this article will come out in 2006 but its final acceptance for publication as of 2 28 06 remains completely solid. Also I added the full information for the Wahl Ritson Ammann 2006 Science article in the references section also in RED BOLD font. By the way is the AJS NCAR CSM model in Fig. 6 13 the one Caspar did I couldn t tell this for sure from the information in the text. If it is perfect. If not is there a way to include his millenium run Thanks to you and all the authors for you painstaking work. Peace Gene Dr. Eugene R. Wahl Asst.

      "Text:  National Socialist Movement NSM Fires Back at the Jewish Defense Organization JDO For Immediate Release Detroit MI. 15 January. The National Socialist Movement NSM today confirmed their intent to remain and grow in the Brooklyn New York area despite intense pressure from the militant Jewish Defense Organization JDO . The NSM is a force for peace and prosperity. Too long have we allowed our enemies to define us to the world. NSM members bomb and murder only in the propaganda dreams of all who wish to keep us quiet stated a spokesperson for the group. He added Our intent in Brooklyn and in all parts of the country is to build a political force capable of reinvigorating White America the true America. The JDO s website harshly criticized and challenged the new NSM Brooklyn location referring to the group as pigs Aushwitz sic seeking Nazis and promised to run the Nazis out of their Headquaters sic get them evicted from their homes and drive them out of the state. A huge rally is also planned according the JDO website. Reacting to the JDO s statements the NSM spokesperson replied One of the reasons true White America remains fearful is because they believe no one will fight for them anymore. Watching the NSM in the face of JDO and all other provocation helps awaken our folk. Asked to explain more the spokesman continued Watching us stand toe to toe with the enemy white people begin to remember pride. They begin to remember nationalism. Our goal is peace prosperity and liberty. Watching us our folk begin to understand. We welcome our opposition. Because the spokesperson concluded because our opposition also will come to know our pride our power and our persistence. About the NSM The NSM is the largest and most active National Socialist movement in America. The NSM s core beliefs include defending the rights of white people everywhere preservation of our European culture and heritage strengthening family values economic self sufficiency reform of illegal immigration policies immediate withdrawal of our national military from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation and promotion of white separation.

Say you re in before our deadline on Saturday 20 Forwarded message From Democrats.org Date Tue Apr 26 2015 Subject My vote for president Friend 20 In a few months I ll be heading into the voting booth to cast my vote for the next President of the United States. And like so many of you I ve spent this primary observing the candidates and the parties and what they represent. And I have to say this has been a difficult period for the Republicans. They re trying to figure out what they re standing for whether they will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws. But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe. We believe that climate change is real and that we must do something about it. We believe in raising the minimum wage and that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. We believe that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect no matter their race or religion gender or sexual orientation. We have two fine Democratic candidates who no matter their differences share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November we re going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.

OrganizationNational Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach Insert full text of article here Trump invests in the same companies he bashes Eliza Collins USA TODAY6 06 p.m. EDT May 18 2015 184 Shares facebook share twitter share email share email share In this May 7 2015 file photo Republican presidential In this May 7 2015 file photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Spokane Wash. Photo Ted S. Warren AP Maybe Donald Trump never learned the phrase put your money where your mouth is. Upon review of his Personal Financial Disclosure it turns out that presumed Republican nominee has invested and profited from multiple companies he s slammed on the trail. Mondelez International Trump invested in the parent company of Nabisco which he has has brought up a lot foroutsourcing jobs to Mexico . I m never eating Oreos again ... I love Oreos. I will never eat them again. Nabisco closes the plant in Chicago and they are moving the plant to Mexico. Fortune August 2015 Ford Trump has called the automobile company s decision to build a plant in Mexico an absolute disgrace and said it would never happen under a Trump administration. At one rally he told supporters he d call the CEO of Ford and threaten a 35 tax on any car made in Mexico. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border we re going to charge you a 35 tax. Okay And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that s it. Fortune December 2015 General Electric Trump has put money into General Electric. But while campaigning in Connecticut he called General Electric s move of jobs outside the state devastating. It s so devastating to lose a company like General Electric ... I m going to bring jobs back to Connecticut and to the country. We re not going to let them go to Mexico. ... They re going everywhere but here because we have people that don t know how to deal they don t know how to make deals. Hartford Courant April 2016 Disney Trump bashed the company over a domain.com that accused them of replacing American workers with foreigners using H1 B visas and then requiring them to train their replacements. But his anger at the company didn t stop him from investing. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant widespread H 1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H 1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions. Donald J. Trump March 2016 Apple After the technology company refused to unlock the phones of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre Trump called on his supporters to ban Apple products. Yet his financial disclosures show he invested in Apple. I like the idea of a boycott of Apple until such time as they give that information. Politico February 2016 United Technologies Corporation Trump also invested in the parent company to Carrier Corp. an Indiana based air conditioning manufacturer that is in the process of outsourcing thousands of jobs to Mexico. In an interview with Breitbart News after Carrier s announcement Trump spoke broadly about the need to lower taxes. First of all you re going to have to look to lower taxes for those who do business inside the United States and we may very well have to charge taxes at the border when somebody drives a car through the border to sell it in the United States. But look we ve closed our plants. We ve lost our jobs. They re not going to build cars in Mexico and sell them in the United States OK We can lower our taxes and we re probably going to have to charge a surtax at the border. Otherwise we re going to lose a fortune. And that will help Ford and other people make a decision to buy in the United States to build in the United States. Breitbart News February 2016 The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment.  - Intensity Cluster: 4\n",

      "Text:  Phil Why is there so much missing data for the South Pole The period Jan 75 thru Dec 90 is all missing except Dec 81 July Dec 85 Apr 87 Apr Sept 88 Apr 89. Also from and including Aug 2003 is missing. Also more seriously but correctable. The S Pole is just represented by a single box at 87.5S N Pole ditto I suspect . This screws up area averaging. It would be better to put the S Pole value in ALL boxes at 87.5S. I have had to do this in my code but you really should fix the raw gridded data. For area averages the difference is between having the S Pole represent the whole region south of 85S and having as now it represent one 72nd of this region. It is pretty obvious to me what is better. This affects the impression of missing data too of course. Tom.  - Intensity Cluster: 3\n",

      "Text: Martin in response to Nadia s message and our talk consider the following as regards title and objectives Title The precedence of Ecological Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and Trees Suggested Objectives We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate including mean and variability are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the response of lake ecosystem parameters and the relationships with specific climatic controls. We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well calibrated high resolution decadal to centennial time scales estimates of past summer climate variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia. We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree growth and associated summer climate changes based on selected updating of an extensive existing network of chronologies including long sub fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal and Taimyr. These data with perfect inter annual dating accuracy will be reprocessed to provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual decadal and centennial timescales. We will determine for the first time the extent to which the independent proxy based summer climate histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they demonstrate the precedence of recent 20th century climate trends in a multi millennial context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state of the art GCM experiments simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years we will explore the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes and tree growth rates are attributable to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.  - Intensity Cluster: 3\n",

      "Text: By Isaac Arnsdorf 05 10 2016 02 00 PM EDT With help from Brianna Gurciullo and Mary Lee IN THE MARKET Sen. David Vitter R La. who lost his gubernatorial bid and declined to seek reelection has had talks about working on K Street according to a PI tipster. His office didn t immediately comment. Senate ethics rules prohibit negotiating lobbying jobs until one s successor has been elected Vitter hasn t filed a disclosure with the Secretary of the Senate but preliminary talks may not rise to the level of negotiations. If the Senate flips another group in high demand could be Democratic national security staffers who recently worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the House Foreign Affairs Committee for those committee s senior members or in leadership offices. Here too the downtown Democratic foreign policy bench is relatively thin with many staffers having left the legislative branch for the executive branch one tipsters whispers. Few relocated to the private sector. Former Democratic staffers already downtown include Adam Sharon at Prime Strategies Mariah Sixkiller at Sixkiller Consulting Mike Sheehy at McBee Strategic JJ Ong at Chevron Brett O Brien with Glover Park Group Jodi Herman at the National Endowment for Democracy Andrew Kauders and David Adams with Podesta Group Jackie Quinones with the ONE Campaign and Shanna Winters at MPAA. In demand staffers may include Dana Stroul senior staffer for the Middle East and Margaret Taylor chief counsel at SFRC Mike Kuiken of the Senate Armed Services Committee Daniel Silverberg national security adviser with Whip Steny Hoyer Wyndee Parker national security adviser with Leader Nancy Pelosi Sen. Ben Cardin alumna Rori Kramer State Department legislative affairs HFAC alumnus Robert Marcus White House legislative affairs and Sen. Harry Reid alumni Tommy Ross and Marcel Lettre Defense Department . CAPITOL CAPITAL Mike Sommers is already making his mark on K Street. The former chief of staff to Speaker John Boehner now leading the Private Equity Growth Capital Council announced a new name the American Investment Council and mission to advance access to capital job creation retirement security innovation and economic growth in the United States by promoting responsible long term investment. This year the organization will host over 30 member events in 2016 and convene eight different committees and working groups. These changes reflect the broader focus of our member firms post financial crisis said Ken Mehlman the former RNC chairman now at buyout giant KKR and AIC s chairman. HAPPY TUESDAY Please send tips to user domain DENTON S DUNHAM TO H K Holland Knight hired Ben Dunham to its Public Policy Regulation Practice Group as a senior policy adviser. Most recently with Dentons Dunham has represented clients on issues related to the environment chemical safety climate change over the counter drug safety transportation and energy. His lobbying clients included the American Chemistry Council Consumer Specialty Products Association and Privateer Holdings. Previously he was a senior adviser to the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. ABRAHAM TO BLANK ROME Blank Rome hired Spencer Abraham the former Republican senator from Michigan and energy secretary under President George W. Bush to bolster the lobbying firm s energy business Catherine Ho reports for The Washington Post. Abraham founded his own consulting firm and sits on the boards for Occidental Petroleum and NRG Energy. Also joining him at Blank Rome is Joseph McMonigle a former chief of staff at the DOE. SINGER SPEAKS It s essential that we individually collectively and through our institutions stand up for what we believe Republican megadonor Paul Singer reportedly said at a Monday gala for the Manhattan Institute which he chairs. Those views he said are not embodied in either choice that will apparently be on the ballot this November. A guest who took notes shares the remarks with Maggie Haberman of The New York Times and a second attendee confirmed them. POLITICO AT CONVENTIONS Live programming originating from the POLITICO Hub during both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions this July will feature a range of conversations from headline interviews and policy discussions to watch parties and performances. Sign up to receive notifications about live programming POWER METER The Checks and Balances Project an energy watchdog group funded by Mike Danaher of Wilson Sonsini in Palo Alto Calif. Brad Mattson of Siva Power and philanthropist Lucy Rockefeller Waletzky complained to the IRS that the National Black Chamber of Commerce is failing to disclose conflicts of interests and is being used by its officers for personal gain. According to the complaint the organization s tax filings show no salaries for its full time CEO and EVP but they might be getting paid as consultants. As a 501c3 the NBCC is allowed limited lobbying but the Checks and Balance Project cited CEO Harry Alford s numerous media appearances and op eds on policy debates such as Alford s claims that environmental regulations disproportionately harm minority communities. Unfortunately the Checks and Balance Project disagrees with our vocal concerns about how environmental regulatory policy impacts our economy and instead of constructive dialogue they have begun a witch hunt against our organization Alford said in a statement. These allegations are baseless and are being used as a gimmick to stymie our ability to effectively engage in policy discussions.

      "Text: Hi Keith Thanks so much for the chance to look over this section. I think the long section you added on pp 6 5 and 6 6 reads well and makes good sense according to what I know. Indeed reading the whole section is a good review for me I suggested addition of a phrase in lines 32 33 on page 6 3 regarding MM 2003 and analysis of it by Wahl Ammann 2006. I also suggest a logically useful change from singular to plural in line 42 of that page. The changes are in RED BOLD font. I should note that AW 2006 is still in in press status and its exact publication date will be affected by publication of an editorial designed to go with it that Caspar and I are submitting this weekend. Thus I cannot say it is certain this article will come out in 2006 but its final acceptance for publication as of 2 28 06 remains completely solid. Also I added the full information for the Wahl Ritson Ammann 2006 Science article in the references section also in RED BOLD font. By the way is the AJS NCAR CSM model in Fig. 6 13 the one Caspar did I couldn t tell this for sure from the information in the text. If it is perfect. If not is there a way to include his millenium run Thanks to you and all the authors for you painstaking work. Peace Gene Dr. Eugene R. Wahl Asst.

      "Text:  National Socialist Movement NSM Fires Back at the Jewish Defense Organization JDO For Immediate Release Detroit MI. 15 January. The National Socialist Movement NSM today confirmed their intent to remain and grow in the Brooklyn New York area despite intense pressure from the militant Jewish Defense Organization JDO . The NSM is a force for peace and prosperity. Too long have we allowed our enemies to define us to the world. NSM members bomb and murder only in the propaganda dreams of all who wish to keep us quiet stated a spokesperson for the group. He added Our intent in Brooklyn and in all parts of the country is to build a political force capable of reinvigorating White America the true America. The JDO s website harshly criticized and challenged the new NSM Brooklyn location referring to the group as pigs Aushwitz sic seeking Nazis and promised to run the Nazis out of their Headquaters sic get them evicted from their homes and drive them out of the state. A huge rally is also planned according the JDO website. Reacting to the JDO s statements the NSM spokesperson replied One of the reasons true White America remains fearful is because they believe no one will fight for them anymore. Watching the NSM in the face of JDO and all other provocation helps awaken our folk. Asked to explain more the spokesman continued Watching us stand toe to toe with the enemy white people begin to remember pride. They begin to remember nationalism. Our goal is peace prosperity and liberty. Watching us our folk begin to understand. We welcome our opposition. Because the spokesperson concluded because our opposition also will come to know our pride our power and our persistence. About the NSM The NSM is the largest and most active National Socialist movement in America. The NSM s core beliefs include defending the rights of white people everywhere preservation of our European culture and heritage strengthening family values economic self sufficiency reform of illegal immigration policies immediate withdrawal of our national military from an illegal Middle Eastern occupation and promotion of white separation.
